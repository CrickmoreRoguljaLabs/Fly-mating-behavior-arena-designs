Arena designs for fly mating behaviors

These pdf files are in the Adobe Illustrator format and are designed to be used with an acrylic cutter. The "syntax" of the cutter are explained in magenta in each pdf file. These files can be adapted for other shop methods.

The .xlsx file lists the acrylic boards we used to manufacture the arenas.
